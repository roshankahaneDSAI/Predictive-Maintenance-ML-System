# Predictive-Maintenance-ML-System
This project performs machine predictive maintenance by classifying whether a machine will fail or not, and if a failure occurs, predicting the type of failure, such as Heat Dissipation Failure, Power Failure, Overstrain Failure, Tool Wear Failure, Random Failures, or No Failure if the machine does not fail.
